# Quick-Draw Maccaw

Quick-Draw Maccaw is a multiplayer progressive web application where your best drawing and detective skills are put to the test!
Race against the clock to either draw a word or guess the word being drawn.

## Getting Started

- [Quick-Draw Maccaw](http://quick-draw-maccaw.herokuapp.com) - Our deployed site! Access via any computer or smart device to play against your friends.

### Mobile Setup

## Built With

- [Socket.io](https://socket.io/docs/) - Used for all real-time data being transferred between users in our app. This is highlighted in the chatroom of the Lobby and in the Canvas being rendered in real time between artists and guessers.
- [React-Canvas-Draw](https://github.com/embiem/react-canvas-draw) - A Canvas drawing component built on top of React, which was used for our game components.
- [Redux](https://redux.js.org/) - Used in conjunction with Socket.io to keep data transfer between all users real-time.
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - Our front-end framework.
- [React-Bootstrap](https://react-bootstrap.github.io/) - Styling used in conjunction with CSS.
- [Sequelize](https://sequelize.org/) - Used to build our data models.
- [Express](https://expressjs.com/) - Used to serve up our data.
- [PostgreSQL](https://www.postgresql.org/) - Our backend database, used to store words, rooms, and users. Allows for us to associate users and rooms to use eagerloading. PostgreSQL is an object-relational database management system (ORDBMS) based on POSTGRES.
